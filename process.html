            <h1>Welcome to my design process &#128516;</h1>

            <p>
                When I found out we had to make a portfolio website for our exam, I started right away. But at that time I han another idea in mind. I work a lot on this website. But when it got the time where we go the actual description of what the website should contain, I change my mind. I didn't like my old design any more, and I wanted something new. So I erased everything and started from scratch. These two wireframes are from my old design:
            </p>

            <div class="old-port-img">
                <div class="old-wireframe1"></div>
                <div class="old-wireframe2"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pre-work">
            <h1>Preperation</h1>
            <p>
                When I started to work on this portfolio page, the first thing I did was make a list of what the website should contain. Specificly what this page should contain according to the requrements for my exam. 
                <br><br>
                Since I decided to start from scratch with my website, I began to make a moodboard, so I could get some inspiration for how I should look like:
            </p>

            <div class="moodboard-img"></div>

            <p>
                Now that I had an idea of how my porfolio should like, I started drawing wireframes for my different pages:
            </p>

            <div class="new-port-img">
                <div class="new-wireframe1"><h2>Homepage</h2></div>
                <div class="new-wireframe2"><h2>About me</h2></div>
                <div class="new-wireframe3"><h2>Portfolio</h2></div>
                <div class="new-wireframe4"><h2>Procss</h2></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                As you may have noticed, the "about me" page and the "portfolio" page, look a bit different then I originally meant for it. The gid in the about me page was too complicated to get to fit right on multiple platforms (phone, desktop, etc.), so I ended up changeing it. My original idea for the portfolio page didn't turn out as I thought as soon as I started making it. I therefore got the idea with making tabs, so it was easier to navigate about.
            </p>

            <h1>Project planning</h1>
            <p>
                During the entire project, I have timed each part, so to document how much it takes to make. All this is documented throught a PBS and WBS:
            </p>

            <div class="project-planning-img">
                <div class="pbs-img"></div>
                <div class="wbs-img"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                I could now create an information architecture and a style guide:
            </p>

            <div class="project-planning-img">
                <div class="infoarchitecture"></div>
                <div class="style-guide"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="design-explained">
                <h1>Website design explained</h1>
                <p>
                    <span>Moodboard</span> <br>

                    One of the first things that I wanted to change about my website, was the background. In my moodboard I have a picture from <a href="https://pernillelind.dk/">Pernille Linds</a> website. Her background inspired me to make one of my own. <br><br>

                    When I was younger (and still) I really liked coloring mandalas. I've always found them quite beautiful, and thats why I chose to draw a mandala for my background. <br><br>

                    I found inspiration online an traced it in Adobe Illustrator, and gave it a color that worked well with the other background I already had. <br><br>

                    The other background I have has a paperlike texture. That inspiration came from <a href="https://www.niccolomiranda.com/">Miranda paper portfolio</a>. I really liked how she made her portfolio look like newspaper, and chose to make something similar for my homepage. I took this paper texture and combined it with my mandala, and that is what you can see on every page. <br><br>

                    <span>AIDA</span><br>
                    One thing I really liked from Mirandas page, was the scrollable text she had at the bootom of her front page (marquee tag in html). It captures the users <strong>attention</strong> and make them <strong>interested</strong> in what's to come. <br><br>

                    By having an About Me page, it helps tell people more about who they are dealing with. Createting a <strong>desire</strong> for the user to work with out. In my About Me page a also have a contact box. It gives the user the possibility to take <strong>action</strong> and contact me. <br><br>

                    <span>CRAP</span><br>
                    <strong>Contrast:</strong><br>
                    My website is build on a hierarchy. For example by writing in the order of h1, h2, h3, p in HTML. That way, the biggest and boldest text is always on top.

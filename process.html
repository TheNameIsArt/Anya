        <div class="old-port">
            <p>
                When I found out we had to make a portfolio website for our exam, I started right away. But at that time I han another idea in mind. I work a lot on this website. But when it got the time where we go the actual description of what the website should contain, I change my mind. I didn't like my old design any more, and I wanted something new. So I erased everything and started from scratch. These two wireframes are from my old design:
            </p>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="img/old-wireframe1.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">

                <img src="img/old-wireframe2.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <div id="modal3" class="modal"      onclick="this.style.display='none'">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <div class="modal-content">
                  <img id="img3">
                </div>
            </div>
            
        </div>

        <h1 class="port-header">Preperation</h1>
        <div class="pre-work">
            
            <p>
                When I started to work on this portfolio page, the first thing I did was make a list of what the website should contain. Specificly what this page should contain according to the requrements for my exam. 
                <br><br>
                Since I decided to start from scratch with my website, I began to make a moodboard, so I could get some inspiration for how I should look like:
            </p>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="div/moodboard.png" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <p>
                Now that I had an idea of how my porfolio should like, I started drawing wireframes for my different pages:
            </p>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="img/new-wireframe1.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">

                <img src="img/new-wireframe2.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="img/new-wireframe3.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">

                <img src="img/new-wireframe4.jpg" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <div id="modal4" class="modal"      onclick="this.style.display='none'">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <div class="modal-content">
                  <img id="img4">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                As you may have noticed, the "about me" page and the "portfolio" page, look a bit different then I originally meant for it. The grid in the about me page was too complicated to get to fit right on multiple platforms (phone, desktop, etc.), so I ended up changeing it. My original idea for the portfolio page didn't turn out as I thought as soon as I started making it. I therefore got the idea with making tabs, so it was easier to navigate about.
            </p>

            <h1 class="port-header">Project planning</h1>
            <p>
                During the entire project, I have timed each part, so to document how much it takes to make. All this is documented throught a PBS and WBS:
            </p>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="img/pbs-img.png" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">

                <img src="img/wbs-img.png" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <p>
                I could now create an information architecture and a style guide:
            </p>

            <div class="modalContainer">
                <img src="img/infoarkitektur.png" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">

                <img src="img/style-guide.png" onclick="onClick(this)" class="modalImg">
            </div>

            <div id="modal5" class="modal"      onclick="this.style.display='none'">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <div class="modal-content">
                  <img id="img5">
                </div>
            </div>

            <h1 class="port-header">Website design explained</h1>
            <div class="design-explained">
                <p>
                    <span>Generally</span> <br>

                    One of the first things that I wanted to change about my website, was the background. In my moodboard I have a picture from <a href="https://pernillelind.dk/">Pernille Linds</a> website. Her background inspired me to make one of my own. <br><br>

                    When I was younger (and still) I really liked coloring mandalas. I've always found them quite beautiful, and thats why I chose to draw a mandala for my background. <br><br>

                    I found inspiration online an traced it in Adobe Illustrator, and gave it a color that worked well with the other background I already had. <br><br>

                    The other background I have has a paperlike texture. That inspiration came from <a href="https://www.niccolomiranda.com/">Miranda paper portfolio</a>. I really liked how she made her portfolio look like newspaper, and chose to make something similar for my homepage. I took this paper texture and combined it with my mandala, and that is what you can see on every page. <br><br>

                    From the beginning I chose that I wanted to work with moslty light colors, and then use darker colors for hightlights and hover effetc. This way it would be easy to see text and display images and elements. <br><br>

                    <span>AIDA - Attention Interest Desire Action</span> <br>

                    The first thing you see when you open my website is the word "EVERYTHING!". This immediately captures the users attention, and tells them that everything they need to now about me, can be found here.<br><br>

                    The second thing that creares attention, is the giant name tag. It shows that this is my page, and you've come to th right place. Lastly I have the scrolling text at the bottom. This was an inspiration that I got from Mirandas website. It really captures ones attention and makes one want to take action, and click on the "EMAIL ME" button. <br><br>

                    On my homepage is a video about some of my passions. This makes the users more interested in getting to know me, and learn more about me. It also creates and interest when people can see that you took the time to create a video for your page. <br><br>

                    My "about me" page, helps telling people more about who they are dealing with. First it shows some more pictures of me, then tells more about who I am and what I can do. This helps give the users a desire to work with me. <br><br>

                    Below is a "contact me" box. This can also make the user take action, and contact me. The "contact me" box is specificly placed here, so that the user easily can contact me, after reading more about me. <br><br>

                    <span>CRAP - Contrast Repetition Alignment Proximity</span> <br>

                    My website is build on a hierarchy. For example by writing in the order of h1, h2, h3, p in HTML. That way, the biggest and boldest text is always on top. Also I create a contrast through my shapes. The light pink seethrough boxes, that are behind most of the text on my website, have normal pointy corners, while images and element inside this box, have rounded corners. <br><br>

                    My website has repetition in the way that on every page there is the same margin in the sides of the content. The reason I did this, is so that it's easier to view the content. That way there isn't text as wide as the entire screen, but everything is together in the middle. <br><br>

                    All items and images on my website are alligned. Everytime two or more pictures are next to each other, they always have the same height. Moreover, all element are placed in proximity, so the user always knows which parts belongs together. <br><br>
